        <p>Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found in all regions of the Earth except Antarctica and some remote islands.Owls are divided into two families: the Strigidae family of true (or typical) owls; and the Tytonidae family of barn-owls.(cited from <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owl</a>)</p>
